# Project2
1. Run Baseline System:

Put the train.txt and test.txt  in the same folder with `baseline.ipynb`.
The first part is for training and validation, and the second part is for output prediction of test data.

2. HMM model

Make sure train.txt and test.txt in the same folder with `baseline.py`
Make sure `lib` folder exists! 
`lib` folder has main `HMM.py` file which is called by `baseline.py`
Run baseline.py directly.
Run on python3!

3. CRF model
Open the CRF.ipynb using jupyter notebook and run the blocks one by one.
